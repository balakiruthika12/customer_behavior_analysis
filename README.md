📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data in Python to building an interactive Power BI dashboard and creating a final analytical report.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights, ensure data quality, and present findings in a clear and business-ready format.

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains structured records relevant to the business problem.

Data includes both numerical and categorical fields.

Initial data quality issues such as missing values and inconsistencies were addressed during the cleaning phase.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python – Data loading, cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data manipulation and visualization

PostgreSQL – SQL querying and data analysis

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

Excel / CSV – Data storage and transfer

🔍 Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Verified data structure, data types, and initial rows.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data distributions and key metrics.

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Generated visualizations to understand trends and patterns.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and invalid values.

Corrected data types and standardized formats.

Removed duplicates and ensured data accuracy.

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

Executed SQL queries to:

Aggregate key metrics

Filter and segment data

Answer business-specific questions

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to the processed dataset.

Created interactive visuals such as:

KPIs
